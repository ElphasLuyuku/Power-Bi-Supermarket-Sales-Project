# Power-Bi-Supermarket-Sales-Project
This Power Bi report is on sales of a supermarket located in 5 locations. The dashboard has two pages one of Revenue Analysis and the other on Profit Analysis.
The dashboard is fully interactive and it enables you to filter from one location to the other.
The profit analysis side of the dashboard shows the most profitable locations and also how much each location contributes to the overall profit.
